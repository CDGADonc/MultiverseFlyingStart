        <h2>What I did Before</h2>
        <p>Before moving on to this apprenticeship I worked as part of Direct Line Group's Motor Change team, providing front line trouble shooting to end users, triaging and escalating defects to key stakeholders for remediation</p>

      <h2>My favourite software</h2>
      <p>I love a good game, I'm a big fan of Overwatch and as far as games go find it pretty relaxing and enjoyable. In terms of technical sides of thingtgs I've loging VS Code so far as it seems pretty tidy and logical to use which suits me down to a T.</p>

      <h2>My experience</h2>
      <ul>
        <h3>What have you done with code so far?</h3>
        <li>Started coding at around 14 via night classes at colleage, with a little bit of Visual Basic</li>
        <li>Picked up some more experience at university but didn't really do much with it as at the time my key goal was to go into teaching</li>
        <li>AFter leaving university and teaching for a bit I found myself writing some code for fun, eventually I developed a full blown application for iOS designed to enable my wife (who has various muscular and joint disabilities) to play computer games more effectively. Sadly this wasn't commercially viable but did prove a fascinating experience and a lot of fun until kids came on the scene forcing this to take a back seat</li>
        <h3>Have you made something?</h3>
        <li>In terms of actual completed end products I produced a number of iOS apps using Objective C. The major project that I completed was referred to as Tap Play, designed as a software keyboard for iPhone or iPad devices to allow this with limited use. This was done in some part by cannibalising open source code but with input from my wife in terms of some of the graphical elements.</li>

        <li>I'm definitely more of a logical, design isn't my thing, if I'm left to design UI it has a tendancy to come across as a later 90's Geocities Site, which while valid at the time doesn't do great in todays internet.  </li>

      <h2>My ambitions</h2>
      <p><h3>This is what I'd like to achieve</h3> </p>
      <p>At the minute I don't actually know what my goal is. I've had an interest in software design for a long time and have taken the opportunity offered by DLG, but I don't really have an 'end goal' so to speak and have very much decided to run with the course and see what I find I have an aptitude for and take things from there. I think in broad terms having worked in the triage role for our guidewire migration and seen some of the issues we have with it I'd be very keen to end up involved with that within DLG as I do believe we have a lot of room for improvement right now.</p>

      <h2>My hobbies</h2>
      <UL>
      <li>My 'main' hobby is probably video games, I have an eclectic taste and will play almost anything at least once to see if I enjoy it, but have put hours into various MMO's and FPS games over time.</li>
      <li>I've also got into tabletop games with my son as he's approaching that age where he's starting to get into things such as Warhammer and find that provides a great opportunity for us to spend time together.</li>

      <h2>Anything else?</h2>
      <p><h3>What else would you like to tell us about?</p></h3>
      <p>I have a tendancy to get 'stuck' in a problem, not in the sense that I can't solve it, but that I often find myself obsessing with dealing with it, while this can be a strength I often struggle to realise when I need to let my mind rest for a bit in order to retake on the problem later. In terms of learning, I tend to learn very much by doing. I can't stand just 'seeing' or being told how to do something, I have to get my hands dirty and try doing it, possibly over and over on occasion, in order for things to sink in fully.  </p>
